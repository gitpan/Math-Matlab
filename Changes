Revision history for Math-Matlab.

0.08  
	NOTE: This version is incompatible with servers from previous versions.
	      Local and Remote must both be running 0.08 or later.
	- Improved error handling by using a Matlab wrapper that uses try/catch
	  and evalc (suggested by Medi Montaseri <montaseri@gmail.com>).
	- Updated to use -r and -logfile args to Matlab instead of STDIN and
	  STDOUT. Using -logfile captures the STDERR as well as STDOUT.
	- Removed create_cmd_file() and added remove_files() in Math::Matlab::Local.
